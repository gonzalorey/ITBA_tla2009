Start conditions are declared in the definitions (first)
section of the input using unindented lines beginning with
either `%s' or `%x' followed by a list of names. The former
declares inclusive start conditions, the latter exclusive
start conditions. A start condition is activated using the
BEGIN action. Until the next BEGIN action is executed, rules
with the given start condition will be active and rules with
other start conditions will be inactive. If the start condition
is inclusive, then rules with no start conditions at all will
also be active. If it is exclusive, then only rules qualified
with the start condition will be active. A set of rules<ref name="google" />
contingent on the same exclusive start condition describe a
scanner which is independent of any of the other rules in the
flex input. Because of this, exclusive start conditions make it
easy to specify "mini-scanners" which scan portions of the input
that are syntactically different from the rest (e.g., comments).
