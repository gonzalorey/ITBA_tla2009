[[File:revengesith.jpg|thumb|alt=Alt text|Episode III]]

Following his instincts, Obi-Wan meets with Padmé, who refuses to believe that her husband has fallen to the dark side. She travels to Mustafar to meet up with Anakin, unaware that Obi-Wan has secretly stowed aboard her spacecraft. Once she confronts Anakin, however, she realizes that Obi-Wan was telling the truth. Anakin spots Obi-Wan aboard Padmé's ship and accuses her of betraying him, using the Force to strangle her into unconsciousness. Obi-Wan and Anakin then engage in an epic lightsaber duel across the volcanic facility and over a river of lava. Finally, Obi-Wan gains the "high ground" and severs Anakin's legs and left arm in midair. Anakin slides down a bank of volcanic ash and bursts into flames, while Obi-Wan picks up Anakin's lightsaber and leaves him to die. Obi-Wan escorts the injured Padmé to the asteroid [[List of Star Wars planets (O-Q)|Polis Massa]] where he regroups with Senator Organa and Yoda, the latter of whom has gone into self-imposed exile after dueling Darth Sidious to a stalemate. Meanwhile, Sidious finds his maimed apprentice and takes him back to Coruscant to revive him.

Padmé gives birth to twins, a boy named [[Luke Skywalker|Luke]] and a girl named [[Princess Leia Organa|Leia]]. Padmé insists to Obi-Wan that there is still good in Anakin, then dies, due to Vader's attack. Meanwhile, Sidious has Darth Vader rebuilt in black cybernetic body armor to keep him alive. When Vader asks for Padmé, Sidious tells him that she died as a result of Vader's anger. This revelation shatters what remains of Anakin's spirit, and he screams in torment. He is last seen at Palpatine's side, overseeing the construction of the first [[Death Star]].

Since Anakin's children are the last hope for [[Star Wars galaxy|the galaxy]], Obi-Wan, Yoda and Organa agree that they should be separated and hidden. Organa takes Leia to [[Alderaan]] to be raised by him and his wife, while Obi-Wan takes Luke to [[Tatooine]] to be raised by his uncle [[Owen Lars|Owen]] and aunt [[Beru Whitesun|Beru]].
